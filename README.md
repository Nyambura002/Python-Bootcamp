**Question 2. Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?**

**Measuring the Success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) Product**

Based on the analysis from the randomly generated data, the success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) product could be measured through a multifaceted approach that involves analyzing various key metrics related to user engagement, growth, and content popularity. In order to comprehensively evaluate IGTV's performance, we've developed a set of Python scripts that aid in this measurement process.

1. **Data Loading:**
   The first step is to load the data from a provided CSV file. The script `data.py` utilizes Pandas to load the data into a DataFrame, which acts as the foundation for subsequent analysis.

2. **Measuring Metrics:**
   The script `measure_metrics.py` focuses on calculating essential metrics to gauge IGTV's success. Key metrics such as mean and median viewing duration, likes, comments, and shares are calculated from the provided data. These metrics provide insights into user engagement and interaction with the IGTV content.

3. **Visualizing Metrics (Optional):**
   An optional visualization step was initially included to create visual representations of the calculated metrics using Matplotlib. However, if visualization is not required, this section can be excluded from the script, and the metrics can be directly printed to the console.

By employing these scripts and analyzing the resulting metrics, one can gain valuable insights into how users engage with IGTV content. These insights are essential in assessing the success of IGTV as a product and can guide further improvements and strategies to enhance user experience and drive growth.
